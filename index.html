                    <strong><em>Location: Seoul, Korea<br>
                    Role: Event Management, Curation <br>
                    Collaborated with team X-Press, designed by Sangmin Cha<br></strong></em>

                    
                    <p>The exhibition is inspired by Georges Perec's novel "Things," 
                        which  profoundly depicts young people's struggle with their unfulfilled aspirations for wealth and a luxurious lifestyle. 
                        "XPress" is portrayed within "Things" as a magazine symbolizing the lifestyle ambitions of the youth, 
                        encapsulating their dreams for the future. <br></p>

                        <p>
                        
                        In the 1920s Paris setting of the novel, the young professionals Jérôme and Sylvie are entangled in their desires for an affluent and stylish life, 
                        illustrating their frustration and despair stemming from their inability to meet these high societal expectations, 
                        despite not being in dire poverty. </p>
                        
                        
                        <p>"XPress" acts as a bridge between personal taste and the harsh reality, making it difficult for the youth to escape their illusions. 
                            As individuals come close to achieving their ideal, they find themselves trapped in a liminal space between being newcomers and established figures.</p>
                            
                            <p>In this exhibition and the magazine X-Press Seoul, curators, audiences, and authors unite to conceptualize a 'Sylvie' living in today's Seoul, South Korea. 
                                Through her portrayal, they seek to investigate the contemporary lifestyle ideals represented by the 'XPress.' 
                                Participants share their own experiences of navigating between personal aspirations and reality. Meanwhile, 
                                'The Room of Ideals'(이상의 방) uses light, shadow, and video to metaphorically express each person's unique ideals.</p>

                    This creative reinterpretation allowed us to explore the lives of our 'Sylvies' in Seoul, 
                    examining our personal and shared ambitions against the backdrop of societal standards.</p><br>

                    <p>
                    The project is funded by the Seoul Foundation for Arts and Culture and was made possible through the collaboration 
                    of a designer, translators, writers, and project participants and our team members.
