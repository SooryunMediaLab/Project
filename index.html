                        As we had a clear concept for the project based on a novel, the main focus of the exhibition was to create an event that felt like a magazine launch. 
                        I participated in preparing documents and presentations, and contacting artists and designers. 
                        I worked closely with the designer to develop the design and visual concept. One side of the exhibition space was set up with artworks from various artists, while the other side was created by our team.

                </strong>

                    <p><strong>Exhibition Details:</strong><br>The exhibition is inspired by Georges Perec's novel "Things," 
                        which  profoundly depicts young people's struggle with their unfulfilled aspirations for wealth and a luxurious lifestyle. 
                        "XPress" is portrayed within "Things" as a magazine symbolizing the lifestyle ambitions of the youth, 
                        encapsulating their dreams for the future. <br></p>

                        <p>
                        In the 1920s Paris setting of the novel, the young professionals Jérôme and Sylvie are entangled in their desires for an affluent and stylish life, 
                        illustrating their frustration and despair stemming from their inability to meet these high societal expectations. </p>
                        
                            <p>The exhibition started from imagining, "What if they lived in Seoul right now? What would they desire?" 
                                Through the portrayal of 'Sylvie,' we explored the contemporary lifestyle ideals represented by 'X-Press Seoul, instead of XPress in the novel.' 
                                Participants shared their own experiences of navigating between personal aspirations and reality. 
                                Meanwhile, 'The Room of Ideals' (이상의 방) uses light, shadow, and video to metaphorically express each person's unique ideals.</p>

                    The project is funded by the Seoul Foundation for Arts and Culture and was made possible through the collaboration 
                    of a designer, translators, writers, and project participants and our team members.
